# CNS-Assignment-1
#Computer and Network security - assignments on encryption and decryption
- Encryption and Decryption of data based on the choice of user
- The System accepts data and keys and generates a its own key and encrypt the data

  #AES Modules:
  This module is found in AES.java class which performs encryption and decryption of a certain given data. The class contains properties and methods. Each property is     stated purposely for secured key generation features, key specification, parameters etc. There are also methods that can perform the desired operations.In this case     there are three methods that perform the core functionality of the module. Those are:

    The generate_key() method:
  The method take one parameter as an argument which the incoming key from the user
  It generates its own key based on the incoming key and sets the value to a variable.
     The encrypt() method:
  It takes two parameters as an argument which is the incoming data from the user and the key generated from the system.
  The method performs its encryption. In this case the system uses a built class to work on encryption of data.
  Return the ciphertext
     The decrypt() method:
  It takes two parameters as an argument which is the incoming data from the user and the key generated from the system.
  The method performs its encryption. In this case the system uses a built class to work on encryption of data.
  Return the ciphertext

  The decrypt() method:
    It takes two parameters as an argument which is the incoming data from the user and the key generated from the system.
    The method performs its encryption. In this case the system uses a built class to work on encryption of data.
    Return the ciphertext
  
  # OTP Modules:
    This module is found in OTP.java class which performs encryption and decryption of a certain given data. The class contains properties and methods. Each property      is stated purposely for secure random number generator, and other properties. There are also methods that can perform the desired operations.In this case there are    three methods that perform the core functionality of the module. Those are:

   The generate_key() method:
    The method takes two parameters: the incoming key from the user and the incoming data.
    It generates its own key based on the incoming data and sets the value to a variable.
   The encrypt() method:
    It takes two parameters as an argument which is the incoming data from the user and the key generated from the system.
    The method performs its encryption. In this case the system uses a built class to work on encryption of data.
